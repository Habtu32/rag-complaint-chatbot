    "The main findings and recommended actions are as follows: the model tends to overgeneralize when the retrieved context is too narrow, so a context-length guard should be implemented (for example, if the total retrieved context falls below a defined threshold, the system should return “I do not have enough information to answer this question”) and answers should always include provenance; many retrieved excerpts contain strong emotional signals, indicating the need for a lightweight sentiment or emotion classifier applied to retrieved documents, with corresponding flags or scores surfaced in the evaluation export to support triage; retrieval quality itself appears strong, so the existing `vector_store.similarity_search` approach should be retained, while adding systematic logging of top-k excerpts and quantitative retrieval checks (such as precision@1/3/5 on a labeled subset), along with CSV exports, to ensure auditability and enable periodic, data-driven evaluation."
